##Sorting Algorithms

 Bubble Sort:
 One of the simplest algorithms yet one of the most time consuming. Moving through the collection of numbers, comparing one after the other, swapping as you go.

 How it works:
 E.g. 
 - int[] array = {3,4,2}
 - compare is 3 > 4 = false
 - compare is 4 > 2 = true - so swap their positions
 - int[] array = {3,2,4}
 - compare is 3 > 2 = true - so swap their positions
 - int[] array = {2,3,4}
 - array is now in order

 My approach:
 
 - First Loop acts as counter as the sort process requires multiple iterations
 - Second Loop iterates through the array.
 - If the number to the left is bigger than the right {3,2} - 3 is bigger than 2
 - To avoid over writing the value, the number on the right will be assigned to a variable temporarily e.g {3,2} -> temp=2
 - The value on the right is assign to the value on the left e.g {3,3}
 - The left number is then assign the value of temp {2,3}
 - When both loops are completed - the sorted array is presented
